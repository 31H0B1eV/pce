PCE - IBM PC Emulator
==============================================================================

PCE is an IBM PC emulator. It emulates most (but see below) of the hardware
of an IBM PC 5150. The emulation is complete enough to boot DOS and run most
DOS applications.

Emulated parts:

Part		Status

CPU		A complete 8086/80186 emulator. The specific CPU model can
		be set to 8088, 8086, 80188 or 80186 at run time.

BIOS		The included BIOS is a partially disassembled, slightly
		hacked IBM BIOS dated 1982-10-27.

8237 DMAC	Supported, but not particularily useful yet

8250 UART	Supported

8253 PIT	Only counting modes 0, 2 and 3 are supported at this time

8255 PPI	Supported

8259 PIC	Supported

MDA		Supported

CGA		Supported

HGC		Supported

EGA		Supported. A custom BIOS is included, but a real EGA BIOS
		should work as well.

EMS		Supported, with a custom DOS driver.

XMS		Supported, with a custom DOS driver.

Disks		Only supported through INT 13h ATM.

Mouse		A Microsoft serial mouse is emulated.

Parallel Port	Partially supported. Output is written to a file.

Serial Port	Supported.


Install
==============================================================================

To install do:

./configure
make
make install

The most important options for configure are:

--prefix=path
Set the installation prefix. The default is /usr/local.

--with-x11[=path]
Build the X11 based terminal.

--with-sdl
Build the SDL based terminal.



Configuration
==============================================================================

PCE is configured by means of a config file. A documented example config
file is installed in $(prefix)/etc/pce-ibmpc.cfg.

(note to self: one of these days you really need to document
this stuff properly...)


Running PCE
==============================================================================

After starting the emulator, pce is in command mode (unless the -r
option was used). Type 'h' to get a short summary of the available
commands.

The 'g' command starts the simulation. It can be interrupted by
pressing Ctrl-`.
