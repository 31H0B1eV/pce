PCE - PC Emulator
=================

PCE is an IBM PC hardware emulator. It emulates most (but see below) of
the hardware of an IBM PC 5150. The emulation is complete enough to
boot DOS and run most DOS applications.

Emulated parts:

Part		Status

CPU		A complete 8086/80186 emulator. Switching between 8086/80186
		can be done at runtime. Switching between 8086/8088 and
		80186/80188 can be done at compile time.

BIOS		The included BIOS is a partially disassembled, slightly
		hacked IBM BIOS dated 1982-10-27.

8237 DMAC	Not present (but in the make)

8250 UART	Supported

8253 PIT	Only counting modes 0, 2 and 3 are supported at this time

8255 PPI	Supported

8259 PIC	Supported

MDA		Supported

CGA		Supported

HGC		Supported

EGA		No user defined fonts. Requires a custem bios (included).

Disks		Only supported through INT 13h ATM.

Mouse		A Microsoft serial mouse is emulated.

Parallel Port	Partially supported. Output is written to a file.

Serial Port	Partially supported under Linux.


Install
=======

To install do:

./configure
make
make install

The most important options for configure are:

--prefix=path
Set the installation prefix. Default is /usr/local.

--with-x11[=path]
Build the X11 based terminal. The default for path is /usr/X11R6

--with-sdl
Build the SDL based terminal.

--with-host-clock=clock
Set the host clock speed in Hz. This value is used for display
purposes only and has no impact on program execution.

--enable-tsc
Use the Pentium TSC to get precise instruction timings.


Configuration
=============

PCE is configured by means of a config file. An example config
file is installed in $(prefix)/etc/pce.cfg.

(note to self: one of these days you really need to document
this stuff properly...)


Running PCE
===========

After starting the emulator, pce is in command mode (unless the -r
option was used). Type 'h' to get a short summary of the available
commands.

The 'g' command starts the simulation. It can be interrupted by
pressing Ctrl-`.
